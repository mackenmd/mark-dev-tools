# Mark's Dev Tools

This repository contains personal scripts, VS Code customizations, and configuration files used across all my solo development projects.

## Structure

- `PowerShell/` — PowerShell automation scripts
- `VSCode/` — Settings, tasks, snippets
- `configs/` — Tool configs for Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript
- `Common/` — Shared files like identity.conf

> Everything here is maintained for personal use, with no external collaborators.
