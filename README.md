# Mark's Dev Tools

This repository contains personal scripts, VS Code customizations, and configuration files used across all my solo development projects.


## Project Structure

- `PowerShell/` — Personal automation scripts (e.g., init Git repo, system tools)
- `VSCode/` — Settings, tasks, snippets, or shared launch configs
- `configs/` — Linting, formatting, and TypeScript base configs (.prettierrc, tsconfig, eslint)
- `Common/` — Shared identity files like identity.conf or other reusable JSON/text files

> Everything here is maintained for personal use, with no external collaborators.
